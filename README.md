Introduction

Most of people say: "Malware isn't a toy to play with!", however, I don't hold such an opinion. Malware is fun, if you know how to play with it! ðŸ˜‰ In my opinion, people who think opposite are gloomy and tedious or just afraid of it. Nonetheless, I still DO NOT recommend you using malware for your personal needs and benefits. If you want to ask any type of questions (e. g. Archive password doesn't match; Provided malware doesn't work! etc.) use the "Issues" tab. Also here are the steps if you want to support me and my repository!
